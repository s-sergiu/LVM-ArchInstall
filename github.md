# Setting up Git SSH & GPG:

First step will be to install git and ssh;
- ```sudo pacman -S git openssh```;

## Configuring your SSH key:

Now we can generate a new ssh key with the following command:
- ```ssh-keygen -t ed22519 -c "your@email"
After this is generated inside the ```~/.ssh``` folder we need to copy paste the contents of ```~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub``` and paste it on Github.
- ```cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub```;
Finally you can test your SSH connection with the command: 
- ```ssh -T git@github.com```;

## Configuring your GPG key:

We start by generating a new gpg key with the following command:
- ```gpg --full-generate-key``` (and following the instructions that are prompted on the screen);
After generating our GPG key we need to get the key ID:
- ```gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long```;
And then we need to generate the output that we need to copy paste on Github.
- ```gpg --armor --export <ID>``` (replace <ID> with the ID generated by the command above);
Let's configure git so that it will sign all commits with our new gpg key:
- ```git config --global commit.gpgsign true```;

## Last step configurations to git
There are two last steps that you need to make in order for GPG to function accordinly:

First will be to add the following to your ```~/.bashrc```:
- ```export GPG_TTY=$(tty)```;
And lastly just config the global user.name and user.email in your git:
- ```git config --global user.email "your@email"```;
- ```git config --global user.name "your name"```;

## That's it, now you have git configured with GPG and SSH;
